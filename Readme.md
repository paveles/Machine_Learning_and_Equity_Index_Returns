# Highlights:
## A time-series framework to predict y using rolling window regressions - expanding and fixed window - that features:
 - Clear project structure based on cookiecutter datascience template
- Usage of scikit-learn pipelines that simplify automation of the process
- New scikit-learn time-series cross-validation method. For each period "t" the method uses all data prior to this period to train, vadlidate and choose the best model.
- Programming of new scikit-learn estimators and 
- Notebook that explains and visualizes obtained findings
