Consistent with this hypothesis, the magnitude of the drift is strongly related to the arbitrage risk measure developed by Wurgler and Zhuravskaya (2002). The effect of arbitrage risk is statistically and economically significant in a range of specifications. The results support the view of post-earnings-announcement drift as an underreaction to earnings information.},

We find that hedge funds, the predominant investor group, generate an annualized Fama and French (1993) risk-adjusted return of about 5.5\%, outperforming other investors. Evidence indicates that hedge funds act as arbitrageurs, generating their returns by trading on the mispricing-related factors, e.g. momentum, betting-against-beta, and quality-minus-junk. In the cross section of hedge funds, local, diversified, and active funds outperform their counterparts. On the position level, we document a first-mover advantage.

We show that short fees interact strongly with the returns to eight of the largest and most well-known cross-sectional anomalies. The anomalies effectively disappear within the 80\% of stocks that have low fees, but are especially large among the high-fee stocks, even net of fees.  We propose an explanation for these findings: the shorting premium is arbitrageurs' compensation for the concentrated risk they bear in shorting overpriced stocks. Because this risk is on the short side, a larger premium means a more overpriced stock.  We proxy for shorting risk using stocks'  covariance with the CME portfolio, and demonstrate that a Fama-French   CME factor model largely captures the anomalies' returns within both high- and low-fee stocks.},

Consistent with our hypothesis, announcer returns forecast aggregate earnings. The announcement premium is persistent across stocks, and early (late) announcers earn higher (lower) returns.

	abstract = {A common finding in the literature is that systematic post-announcement drifts in security returns are associated with the sign or magnitude of unexpected earnings changes. This paper examines proposed explanations for these drifts. The paper also documents that the systematic drifts in security returns are found for only a subset of earnings expectations models. For a class of expectations models based on the time series of reported quarterly earnings, variables coding (1) the sign and magnitude of the earnings forecast error and (2) firm size independently explain 81 percent and 61 percent, respectively, of the variation in post-announcement drifts. The joint explanatory power of (1) and (2) is 85 percent, indicating that the effect of these two variables is highly collinear. The drifts are a persistent phenomenon over the 1974 to 1981 period with no evidence of being concentrated in a specific subperios. The properties of expectations models based on the time series of earnings are contrasted with earnings expectations models based on security returns. The latter exhibit no evidence of systematic post-announcement drift behavior. The expectations models based on security returns have the appealing property that the assignment of firms to unexpected earnings change portfolios better approximates the independence-over-time assumption. This property means that these models are less vulnerable to the "proxy effect" criticism that has been made of results previously reported in the literature. The results in this paper are based on a sample of over 56,000 observations covering the 1974 to 1981 time period.},

Part of the recent literature focuses on ad hoc factor models, which summarize the cross section of expected returns in parsimonious form, or on production-based approaches, which suggest links between firm characteristics and expected returns. Without imposing restrictions on investor preferences and beliefs, neither one of these two approaches can answer the question of why investors price assets the way they do. Within the rational expectations paradigm, recent research that imposes such restrictions has focused on the intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM), long-run risks models, as well as frictions and liquidity risk. Approaches based on investor sentiment have focused on the development of empirical proxies for sentiment and for the limits to arbitrage that allow sentiment to affect prices. Empirical work that considers learning and adaptation of investors has worked with out-of-sample tests of cross-sectional predictability.},

Using this methodology, which exploits time-variation in the cross-section of short interest, we document that the amount of capital devoted to value and momentum strategies has grown significantly since the late 1980s. We provide evidence that this increase in capital has resulted in lower strategy returns. However, consistent with theories of limited arbitrage, we show that strategy-level capital flows are influenced by past strategy returns and strategy return volatility and that arbitrage capital is most limited during times when strategies perform best. This suggests that the growth of arbitrage capital may not completely eliminate returns to these strategies.},

We find abnormal levels of short-selling in the three days before downgrades are publicly announced. Further, we show that this pre-announcement abnormal short-selling is significantly related to the subsequent share price reaction to the downgrade, and especially so for downgrades that prompt the most substantial price declines. Our findings are robust to various controls that might also affect short-selling such as pre-announcement momentum, three-day pre-announcement returns, and announcement-day share price. In addition, the results are independent of scheduled earnings announcements, analyst herding, and non-routine events near downgrades. Further evidence suggests that tipping is more consistent with the data than the prediction explanation which posits that short sellers successfully predict downgrades on the basis of public information about firms’ financial health. Finally, we present evidence that downgraded stocks with high abnormal short-selling perform poorly over the subsequent six months by comparison with those with low abnormal short-selling. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that short sellers are informed traders and exploit profitable opportunities provided by downgrade announcements.},

Because of institutional constraints, most professional investors simply never sell short and hence cannot trade against overpricing of stocks they do not own. Furthermore, stock loan supply tends to be sparse and short selling more expensive when institutional ownership is low. Using institutional ownership as a proxy, I find that short-sale constraints help explain cross-sectional stock return anomalies. Specifically, holding size fixed, the under-performance of stocks with high market-to-book, analyst forecast dispersion, turnover, or volatility is most pronounced among stocks with low institutional ownership. Ownership by passive investors with large stock lending programs partly mitigates this under-performance, indicating some impact of stock loan supply. Prices of stocks with low institutional ownership also underreact to bad cash-flow news and overreact to good cash-flow news, consistent with the idea that short-sale constraints hold negative opinions off the market for these stocks.},

While particular groups of institutions have modest stock-picking skill relative to the CAPM, their performance is almost entirely explained by the book-to-market and momentum effects in returns.

High-quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble. Further, a low price of quality predicts a high future return of QMJ. Finally, controlling for quality resurrects the otherwise moribund size effect.},

The unpredictability of noise traders' beliefs creates a risk in the price of the asset that deters rational arbitrageurs from aggressively betting against them. As a result, prices can diverge significantly from fundamental values even in the absence of fundamental risk. Moreover, bearing a disproportionate amount of risk that they themselves create enables noise traders to earn a higher expected return than rational investors do. The model sheds light on a number of financial anomalies, including the excess volatility of asset prices, the mean reversion of stock returns, the underpricing of closed-end mutual funds, and the Mehra-Prescott equity premium puzzle.},
