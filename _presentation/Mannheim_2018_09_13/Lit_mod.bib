abstract = {Using a sample of 97 stock return anomalies documented in published studies, we find that anomaly returns are 7 times higher on earnings announcement days and 2 times higher on corporate news days. The effects are similar on both the long and short sides, and they survive adjustments for risk exposure and data mining. Moreover, anomaly signals predict errors in analysts' earnings forecasts — analysts' forecasts are systematically too low for anomaly-longs and too high for anomaly-shorts. Taken together, our results support the view that anomaly returns are the result of biased expectations, which are at least partially corrected upon news arrival.},

abstract = {Short rebate fees are a strong predictor of the cross-section of stock returns, both gross and net of fees. We document a large "shorting premium": the cheap-minus-expensive-to-short (CME) portfolio of stocks has a monthly average gross return of 1.31{\%}, a net-of-fees return of 0.78{\%}, and a 1.44{\%} four-factor alpha. We show that short fees interact strongly with the returns to eight of the largest and most well-known cross-sectional anomalies. The anomalies effectively disappear within the 80{\%} of stocks that have low fees, but are especially large among the high-fee stocks, even net of fees. We propose an explanation for these findings: the shorting premium is arbitrageurs' compensation for the concentrated risk they bear in shorting overpriced stocks. Because this risk is on the short side, a larger premium means a more overpriced stock. We proxy for shorting risk using stocks' covariance with the CME portfolio, and demonstrate that a Fama-French CME factor model largely captures the anomalies' returns within both high- and low-fee stocks.},

The unpredictability of noise traders' beliefs creates a risk in the price of the asset that deters rational arbitrageurs from aggressively betting against them. As a result, prices can diverge significantly from fundamental values even in the absence of fundamental risk. Moreover, bearing a disproportionate amount of risk that they themselves create enables noise traders to earn a higher expected return than rational investors do. The model sheds light on a number of financial anomalies, including the excess volatility of asset prices, the mean reversion of stock returns, the underpricing of closed-end mutual funds, and the Mehra-Prescott equity premium puzzle.},

We consider a setting in which the presence of market-wide sentiment is combined with the argument that overpricing should be more prevalent than underpricing, due to short-sale impediments. Long-short strategies that exploit the anomalies exhibit profits consistent with this setting. First, each anomaly is stronger (its long-short strategy is more profitable) following high levels of sentiment. Second, the short leg of each strategy is more profitable following high sentiment. Finally, sentiment exhibits no relation to returns on the long legs of the strategies.},

abstract = {Stocks with relatively high short interest subsequently experience negative abnormal returns, but the effect can be transient and of debatable economic significance. In contrast, relatively heavily traded stocks with low short interest experience both statistically and economically significant positive abnormal returns. These positive returns are often larger (in absolute value) than the negative returns observed for heavily shorted stocks. Thus, the positive information associated with low short interest, which is publicly available, is only slowly incorporated into prices, which raises a broader market efficiency issue. Our results also cast doubt on existing theories of the impact of short sale constraints.},

abstract = {Short rebate fees are a strong predictor of the cross-section of stock returns, both gross and net of fees. We document a large "shorting premium": the cheap-minus-expensive-to-short (CME) portfolio of stocks has a monthly average gross return of 1.31{\%}, a net-of-fees return of 0.78{\%}, and a 1.44{\%} four-factor alpha. We show that short fees interact strongly with the returns to eight of the largest and most well-known cross-sectional anomalies. The anomalies effectively disappear within the 80{\%} of stocks that have low fees, but are especially large among the high-fee stocks, even net of fees. We propose an explanation for these findings: the shorting premium is arbitrageurs' compensation for the concentrated risk they bear in shorting overpriced stocks. Because this risk is on the short side, a larger premium means a more overpriced stock. We proxy for shorting risk using stocks' covariance with the CME portfolio, and demonstrate that a Fama-French CME factor model largely captures the anomalies' returns within both high- and low-fee stocks.},

Although variables such as loan fee, loan supply and short interest are determined simultaneously in the market for borrowing stock, new incremental information may be found in each variable examined. Papers such as Beneish et al. (2015) attempt to disentangle the effect of one particular variable, and attempt to shed light on the parallel challenge faced by investors in determining which variables will make the most impact on returns as well as trading costs. We discuss a number of practical approaches to this challenge, and we also consider a potentially new take that considers accounting-data-driven anomalies as one of the possible exogenously determined variables in the equilibrium of the equity loan market.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that stocks with high idiosyncratic risk exhibit stronger anomalies because arbitrageurs avoid holding these stocks due to diversification concerns, allowing deviations of prices from fundamental values. In this paper we test this proposition using hedge fund holding data. Controlling for stock size, we find that hedge funds allocate on average more capital towards holding high idiosyncratic stocks than they do towards low idiosyncratic risk stocks. Contrary to the prediction that diversification concerns prevent arbitrageurs from holding high idiosyncratic risk stocks, we find that the effect is stronger for small hedge funds and for less diversified hedge funds, and does not vary with hedge fund leverage. We also find that hedge fund trades in high idiosyncratic risk stocks earn significantly higher abnormal returns than trades in low idiosyncratic risk stocks. We propose that these results can be reconciled by high idiosyncratic risk being a proxy for information noise about the fundamental value. Consistent with this idea, we find that hedge funds require stronger mispricing signals from highly idiosyncratic stocks before trading.},

The average post-publication decay, which we attribute to both statistical bias and price pressure from aware investors, is about 35{\%}, and statistically different from both 0{\%} and 100{\%}. Our findings point to mispricing as the source of predictability. Consistent with informed trading, after publication, stocks in characteristic portfolios experience higher volume, variance, and short interest, and higher correlations with portfolios that are based on published characteristics. Consistent with costly (limited) arbitrage, post-publication return declines are greater for characteristic portfolios that consist of stocks with low idiosyncratic risk.},

Institutions also show little tendency to bet on any of the main characteristics known to predict stock returns, such as book-to-market, momentum, or accruals. While particular groups of institutions have modest stock-picking skill relative to the CAPM, their performance is almost entirely explained by the book-to-market and momentum effects in returns.

abstract = {Short-sale constraints are most likely to bind among stocks with low institutional ownership. Because of institutional constraints, most professional investors simply never sell short and hence cannot trade against overpricing of stocks they do not own. Furthermore, stock loan supply tends to be sparse and short selling more expensive when institutional ownership is low. Using institutional ownership as a proxy, I find that short-sale constraints help explain cross-sectional stock return anomalies. Specifically, holding size fixed, the under-performance of stocks with high market-to-book, analyst forecast dispersion, turnover, or volatility is most pronounced among stocks with low institutional ownership. Ownership by passive investors with large stock lending programs partly mitigates this under-performance, indicating some impact of stock loan supply. Prices of stocks with low institutional ownership also underreact to bad cash-flow news and overreact to good cash-flow news, consistent with the idea that short-sale constraints hold negative opinions off the market for these stocks.},

Moreover, professional arbitrage is conducted by a relatively small number of highly specialized investors using other people's capital. Such professional arbitrage has a number of interesting implications for security pricing, including the possibility that arbitrage becomes ineffective in extreme circumstances, when prices diverge far from fundamental values. The model also suggests where anomalies in financial markets are likely to appear, and why arbitrage fails to eliminate them.},

We then investigate the profitability of using short interest in trading. We find abnormal returns (1.11 percent per month) from a zero-investment strategy that (1) shorts firms with highly favorable analyst recommendations (buy signal) but high short interest (sell signal), and (2) buys firms with highly unfavorable analyst recommendations (sell signal) but low short interest (buy signal). Short interest, therefore, appears to capture predictive information that can be used by investors in trading against analysts' recommendations to increase returns.},

High-quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble. Further, a low price of quality predicts a high future return of QMJ. Finally, controlling for quality resurrects the otherwise moribund size effect.},

abstract = {This paper studies short-selling prior to the release of analyst downgrades in a sample of 670 downgrades of Nasdaq stocks between 2000 and 2001. We find abnormal levels of short-selling in the three days before downgrades are publicly announced. Further, we show that this pre-announcement abnormal short-selling is significantly related to the subsequent share price reaction to the downgrade, and especially so for downgrades that prompt the most substantial price declines. Our findings are robust to various controls that might also affect short-selling such as pre-announcement momentum, three-day pre-announcement returns, and announcement-day share price. In addition, the results are independent of scheduled earnings announcements, analyst herding, and non-routine events near downgrades. Further evidence suggests that tipping is more consistent with the data than the prediction explanation which posits that short sellers successfully predict downgrades on the basis of public information about firms' financial health. Finally, we present evidence that downgraded stocks with high abnormal short-selling perform poorly over the subsequent six months by comparison with those with low abnormal short-selling. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that short sellers are informed traders and exploit profitable opportunities provided by downgrade announcements.},

Hence, the high–low ratio reflects both the stock's variance and its bid-ask spread. Although the variance component of the high–low ratio is proportional to the return interval, the spread component is not. This allows us to derive a spread estimator as a function of high–low ratios over 1-day and 2-day intervals.

". Recent research suggests a rich array of the determinants of short selling, including size, growth, uncertainty of firm environment, firm complex ity, ease of borrowing the stock, and market liquidity." (Hirshleifer et al 2011:2431)
"In order to sell short, an investor must borrow shares from an investor who owns them and is willing to lend. The short seller typically leaves cash collateral with the lender. In addition to the collateral, equal to 102{\%} of the market value of the borrowed shares, Federal Reserve Regulation T requires short sellers to post an additional 50{\%} in margin when the lender is a U.S. broker-dealer. The lender pays the short seller interest, the rebate rate, on the collateral. The spread between the rebate rate and the market interest rate on cash funds, often referred to as the loan fee, is a direct cost to the short seller." (Hirshleifer et al 2011:2434)
"A key prediction is that low institutional share ownership should be associated with higher return asymmetry" (Hirshleifer et al 2011:2434)
"Liquidity, as proxied inversely by the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure, should encourage arbitrage activity in general. By reducing the risk of short squeezes, it may encourage short arbitrage, thereby reducing return asymmetry." (Hirshleifer et al 2011:2434)
"We use analyst following, residual standard deviation, and book-to-market (since there is likely to be more disagreement about growth firms than mature firms) an whether the firm is earning negative profits (loss firm) to control for differ ences in uncertainty and firm complexity, which should affect disagreement and mispricing." (Hirshleifer et al 2011:2434)
"We also use residual standard deviation and leverage as proxies for the risk of arbitrage, which should increase return asymmetry." (Hirshleifer et al 2011:2435)
"We provide some results separated by exchange (NYSE versus NASDAQ) because the constraints, costs, and risks of arbitrage (and especially short arbitrage) are likely to differ between firms listed on these two exchanges."

abstract = {Textbook arbitrage in financial markets requires no capital and entails no risk. In reality, almost all arbitrage requires capital, and is typically risky. Moreover, professional arbitrage is conducted by a relatively small number of highly specialized investors using other people's capital. Such professional arbitrage has a number of interesting implications for security pricing, including the possibility that arbitrage becomes ineffective in extreme circumstances, when prices diverge far from fundamental values. The model also suggests where anomalies in financial markets are likely to appear, and why arbitrage fails to eliminate them.},

The illiquidity measure here is the average across stocks of the daily ratio of absolute stock return to dollar volume, which is easily obtained from daily stock data for long time series in most stock markets. Illiquidity affects more strongly small firm stocks, thus explaining time series variations in their premiums over time.},

These changes in aggregate preferences have arisen primarily from changes in the preferences of each class of institution, rather than changes in the importance of different classes. Evidence also suggests that recent growth in institutional investment combined with this shift in preferences helps explain why markets in general, and smaller stocks in particular, have exhibited greater firm-specific risk and liquidity in recent years. Additional analyses suggest that institutional investors moved toward smaller securities because such securities offer “greener pastures.”},

We consider a setting in which the presence of market-wide sentiment is combined with the argument that overpricing should be more prevalent than underpricing, due to short-sale impediments. Long-short strategies that exploit the anomalies exhibit profits consistent with this setting. First, each anomaly is stronger (its long-short strategy is more profitable) following high levels of sentiment. Second, the short leg of each strategy is more profitable following high sentiment. Finally, sentiment exhibits no relation to returns on the long legs of the strategies.},

Given that the market clearing condition requires a buyer for every seller, we exploit these cross-sectional patterns and changes in share ownership to test whether investor sentiment metrics capture institutional or individual investors' demand shocks. In contrast to theoretical assumptions and common perceptions, we find no evidence that individual investors' trading is responsible for sentiment-induced demand shocks and mispricing. If the commonly used sentiment metrics truly capture investor sentiment, then institutional investors are the sentiment traders whose demand shocks drive prices from value.},

Although the relation between mispricing and transaction costs is well-known, the relation between mispricing and holding costs is misunderstood. One holding cost, idiosyncratic risk, is particularly misunderstood. Various myths are debunked, including the common myth that idiosyncratic risk matters because arbitrageurs only have access to a small number of projects [Shleifer and Vishny, 1997. The limits of arbitrage. The Journal of Finance 52, 35–55.]. The literature demonstrates that idiosyncratic risk is the single largest cost faced by arbitrageurs.},

abstract = {While it is well known that short selling predicts future negative stock price performance, it has not been established whether short selling predicts future negative operating performance. We find that firms in the top decile of increases in short interest (an increase of about four percentage points) experience a 21{\%} subsequent decline in operating performance relative to matched control firms. The greater the increase in short interest, the larger the decline in operating performance. The results are robust to alternative performance measures and to sample splits based on firm size. These results suggest that short interest may reflect private information about firm fundamentals rather than other factors that may drive stock price changes.},

Contrary to popular accounts that the convexity in fee structure utilized in the hedge fund industry encourages managers to take on risk, our evidence suggests that short arbitrageurs shy away from risk and prefer low-risk, high-return strategies that have weak correlations with other strategies. Correspondingly, we present evidence that short arbitrageurs act in an informed and market-stabilizing manner.},

abstract = {I review recent research efforts in the area of empirical cross-sectional asset pricing. I start by summarizing the evidence on cross-sectional return predictability and the failure of standard (consumption) capital asset pricing models (CAPMs) and their conditional versions to explain these predictability patterns. Part of the recent literature focuses on ad hoc factor models, which summarize the cross section of expected returns in parsimonious form, or on production-based approaches, which suggest links between firm characteristics and expected returns. Without imposing restrictions on investor preferences and beliefs, neither one of these two approaches can answer the question of why investors price assets the way they do. Within the rational expectations paradigm, recent research that imposes such restrictions has focused on the intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM), long-run risks models, as well as frictions and liquidity risk. Approaches based on investor sentiment have focused on the development of empirical proxies for sentiment and for the limits to arbitrage that allow sentiment to affect prices. Empirical work that considers learning and adaptation of investors has worked with out-of-sample tests of cross-sectional predictability.},

Our results differ from numerous studies documenting a positive relation between institutional demand and future returns. We trace the difference to measurement horizon. We too find a positive relation at a quarterly horizon. However, the relation turns strongly negative at the one-year horizon used in anomaly studies. We consider several explanations for institutions' tendency to trade contrary to anomaly prescriptions. Our evidence largely rules out explanations based on flow and limits-of-arbitrage, but is more consistent with agency-induced preferences for stock characteristics that relate to poor long-run performance.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that high short interest stocks have low subsequent returns. We test whether the persistence of this effect is due to costs limiting arbitrage. The arbitrage cost that we focus on is idiosyncratic risk which, regardless of the arbitrageur's level of diversification, deters arbitrage activity. Consistent with costly arbitrage, we find that among high short interest stocks a one standard deviation increase in idiosyncratic risk predicts a more than 1{\%} decline in monthly returns. Moreover, idiosyncratic risk does not predict returns across low short interest stocks, and short interest does not predict low returns across low idiosyncratic risk stocks. Our results are robust to commonly used proxies for both transaction costs and short sale constraints.},

abstract = {Firms scheduled to report earnings earn an annualized abnormal return of 9.9{\%}. We propose a risk-based explanation for this phenomenon, whereby investors use announcements to revise their expectations for nonannouncing firms, but can only do so imperfectly. Consequently, the covariance between firm-specific and market cash flow news spikes around announcements, making announcers especially risky. Consistent with our hypothesis, announcer returns forecast aggregate earnings. The announcement premium is persistent across stocks, and early (late) announcers earn higher (lower) returns. Nonannouncers' response to announcements is consistent with our model, both over time and across firms. Finally, exposure to announcement risk is priced.},

@article{Foster1984,
abstract = {A common finding in the literature is that systematic post-announcement drifts in security returns are associated with the sign or magnitude of unexpected earnings changes. This paper examines proposed explanations for these drifts. The paper also documents that the systematic drifts in security returns are found for only a subset of earnings expectations models. For a class of expectations models based on the time series of reported quarterly earnings, variables coding (1) the sign and magnitude of the earnings forecast error and (2) firm size independently explain 81 percent and 61 percent, respectively, of the variation in post-announcement drifts. The joint explanatory power of (1) and (2) is 85 percent, indicating that the effect of these two variables is highly collinear. The drifts are a persistent phenomenon over the 1974 to 1981 period with no evidence of being concentrated in a specific subperios. The properties of expectations models based on the time series of earnings are contrasted with earnings expectations models based on security returns. The latter exhibit no evidence of systematic post-announcement drift behavior. The expectations models based on security returns have the appealing property that the assignment of firms to unexpected earnings change portfolios better approximates the independence-over-time assumption. This property means that these models are less vulnerable to the "proxy effect" criticism that has been made of results previously reported in the literature. The results in this paper are based on a sample of over 56,000 observations covering the 1974 to 1981 time period.},

abstract = {We examine short selling in US stocks based on new SEC-mandated data for 2005. There is a tremendous amount of short selling in our sample: short sales represent 24{\%} of NYSE and 31{\%} of Nasdaq share volume. Short sellers increase their trading following positive returns and they correctly predict future negative abnormal returns. These patterns are robust to controlling for voluntary liquidity provision and for opportunistic risk-bearing by short sellers. The results are consistent with short sellers trading on short-term overreaction of stock prices. A trading strategy based on daily short-selling activity generates significant positive returns during the sample period.},

"The first alternative suggests that short sellers are either corporate insiders or are privy to advance release of material nonpublic information from the corporation." (Diether et al 2009:576)

"The second alternative suggests that market frictions (Miller, 1977; Harrison and Kreps, 1978; Diamond and Verrecchia, 1987; and Scheinkman and Xiong, 2003) or behavioral biases (DeBondt and Thaler, 1985; Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998; Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam, 1998; and Hong and Stein, 1999) may cause price to deviate from fundamental value in the short run, and that short sellers are exploiting these situations to their benefit." (Diether et al 2009:576)

"Since many institutions are prevented from shorting (e.g., many mutual funds), the ones that may use short selling as part of their strategy tend to be more sophisticated." (Diether et al 2009:576)

"A third alternative is that short sellers act as voluntary liquidity providers." (Diether et al 2009:577)

"A fourth explanation is that short sellers step in to provide additional riskbearing capacity in periods of elevated uncertainty." (Diether et al 2009:577)

"There are two main problems with using monthly short interest data. The first problem is that monthly short interest data do not permit a researcher to discern whether or not a high level of short interest means that short selling is more expensive, which is the prerequisite for the overreaction story as proposed by Miller (1977)." (Diether et al 2009:578)

"The general conclusion reached by this literature is that short-sale costs are higher and short-sale constraints are more binding among stocks with low market capitalization and stocks with low institutional ownership." (Diether et al 2009:578)

"(1) Short sellers are trading on short-term overreaction if they sell short following positive returns and their trades are followed by negative returns. (2) Short sellers are acting as voluntary liquidity providers if they sell short on days with significant buying pressure, and their trades are followed by declining buying pressure and negative returns. (3) Short sellers are acting as opportunistic risk-bearers during periods of elevated asymmetric information if they sell short on days with high intraday volatility and wide spreads, and their trades are followed by days with lower volatility, narrower spreads, and negative returns. (4) Short sellers are acting as opportunistic risk-bearers during periods of differences of opinion if they sell short on days with high intraday volatility and narrow spreads, and their trades are followed by days with lower volatility, wider spreads, and negative returns."

abstract = {A four-factor model with two “mispricing” factors, in addition to market and size factors, accommodates a large set of anomalies better than notable four- and five-factor alternative models. Moreover, our size factor reveals a small-firm premium nearly twice usual estimates. The mispricing factors aggregate information across 11 prominent anomalies by averaging rankings within two clusters exhibiting the greatest return comovement. Investor sentiment predicts the mispricing factors, especially their short legs, consistent with a mispricing interpretation and the asymmetry in ease of buying versus shorting. A three-factor model with a single mispricing factor also performs well, especially in Bayesian model comparisons.},

abstract = {We propose a new method to select amongst a large group of candidate factors -- many of which might arise as a result of data mining -- that purport to explain the cross-section of expected returns. The method is robust to general distributional characteristics of both factor and asset returns. We allow for the possibility of time-series as well as cross-sectional dependence. The technique accommodates a wide range of test statistics. Our method can be applied to both asset pricing tests based on portfolio sorts as well as tests using individual asset returns. In contrast to recent asset pricing research, our study of individual stocks finds that the original market factor is by far the most important factor in explaining the cross-section of expected returns.},

Using a database of short sales combined with a database of news releases, we show that the well-documented negative relation between short sales and future returns is twice as large on news days and four times as large on days with negative news. Further, we find that the most informed short sales are not from market makers but rather from clients, and we find only weak evidence that short sellers anticipate news events. Overall, the evidence suggests that public news provides valuable trading opportunities for short sellers who are skilled information processors.},

A cross-country analysis finds that the premium is strongest in countries with the greatest increase in idiosyncratic volatility around the time of their firms' earnings announcements, suggesting that uncertainty over the earnings information to be disclosed is a primary driver of the global announcement premium.},

The five-factor model׳s main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability. The model׳s performance is not sensitive to the way its factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.},

Consistent with this hypothesis, the magnitude of the drift is strongly related to the arbitrage risk measure developed by Wurgler and Zhuravskaya (2002). The effect of arbitrage risk is statistically and economically significant in a range of specifications. The results support the view of post‐earnings‐announcement drift as an underreaction to earnings information.},

abstract = {This article examines the hypothesis that the superior return to so-called value stocks is the result of expectational errors made by investors. We study stock price reactions around earnings announcements for value and glamour stocks over a 5-year period after portfolio formation. The announcement returns suggest that a significant portion of the return difference between value and glamour stocks is attributable to earnings surprises that are systematically more positive for value stocks. The evidence is inconsistent with a risk-based explanation for the return differential.},

abstract = {We examine whether short sellers detect firms that misrepresent their financial statements, and whether their trading conveys external costs or benefits to other investors. Abnormal short interest increases steadily in the 19 months before the misrepresentation is publicly revealed, particularly when the misconduct is severe. Short selling is associated with a faster time-to-discovery, and it dampens the share price inflation that occurs when firms misstate their earnings. These results indicate that short sellers anticipate the eventual discovery and severity of financial misconduct. They also convey external benefits, helping to uncover misconduct and keeping prices closer to fundamental values.},

abstract = {We investigate whether stock betas vary with the release of firm-specific news. Using daily firm-level betas estimated from intraday prices, we find that betas increase on earnings announcement days and revert to their average levels two to five days later. The increase in betas is greater for earnings announcements that have larger positive or negative surprises, convey more information about other firms in the market, and resolve greater ex ante uncertainty. Our results are consistent with a learning model in which investors use information on announcing firms to revise their expectations about the profitability of the aggregate economy.},

abstract = {Stocks with relatively high short interest subsequently experience negative abnormal returns, but the effect can be transient and of debatable economic significance. In contrast, relatively heavily traded stocks with low short interest experience both statistically and economically significant positive abnormal returns. These positive returns are often larger (in absolute value) than the negative returns observed for heavily shorted stocks. Thus, the positive information associated with low short interest, which is publicly available, is only slowly incorporated into prices, which raises a broader market efficiency issue. Our results also cast doubt on existing theories of the impact of short sale constraints.},

abstract = {We show that short interest is arguably the strongest known predictor of aggregate stock returns. It outperforms a host of popular return predictors both in and out of sample, with annual R2 statistics of 12.89{\%} and 13.24{\%}, respectively. In addition, short interest can generate utility gains of over 300 basis points per annum for a mean-variance investor. A vector autoregression decomposition shows that the economic source of short interest's predictive power stems predominantly from a cash flow channel. Overall, our evidence indicates that short sellers are informed traders who are able to anticipate future aggregate cash flows and associated market returns.},

abstract = {This paper tests the relationship between average return and risk for New York Stock Exchange common stocks. The theoretical basis of the tests is the "two-parameter" portfolio model and models of market equilibrium derived from the two-parameter portfolio model. We cannot reject the hypothesis of these models that the pricing of common stocks reflects the attempts of risk-averse investors to hold portfolios that are "efficient" in terms of expected value and dispersion of return. Moreover, the observed "fair game" properties of the coefficients and residuals of the risk-return regressions are consistent with an "efficient capital market"--that is, a market where prices of securities},

abstract = {We construct a long daily panel of short sales using proprietary NYSE order data. From 2000 to 2004, shorting accounts for more than 12.9{\%} of NYSE volume, suggesting that shorting constraints are not widespread. As a group, these short sellers are well informed. Heavily shorted stocks underperform lightly shorted stocks by a risk-adjusted average of 1.16{\%} over the following 20 trading days (15.6{\%} annualized). Institutional nonprogram short sales are the most informative; stocks heavily shorted by institutions underperform by 1.43{\%} the next month (19.6{\%} annualized). The results indicate that, on average, short sellers are important contributors to efficient stock prices.},

"For example, Brent, Morse, and Stice (1990) find that monthly short interest does not predict either the cross-section or time-series behavior of returns, Asquith, Pathak, and Ritter (2005) find" (Boehmer et al 2008:491)

"Hedge funds practicing statistical arbitrage ("stat-arb funds") are known to use recent order f low information to anticipate short-term price movements. On the other hand, there can be uninformed shorting, as there is a strong hedging motive that is unique to short sales. For example, convertible arbitrage hedge funds and options market-makers might short a stock as part of their hedging strategy, with little thought to whether the stock itself is overor undervalued. Index arbitrageurs might long futures or some other basket instrument and short the underlying stocks. Market-makers might short shares as a part of their regular buffering activity. Some of these shorts are based on information or opinions about the firm's share price level; some are not. Thus, it seems important to distinguish between these different types of shorts." (Boehmer et al 2008:492)

"predictive power only in the smallest stocks, while authors such as Asquith and Meulbroek (1996) and Desai et al. (2002) find more evidence of predictive power in the cross-section. Lamont and Stein (2004) find that aggregate short interest is extrapolative, reacting to past price moves, but has no predictive power for future market moves." (Boehmer et al 2008:492)

"As mentioned earlier, the evidence is mixed on whether these individual stock short interest reports can be used by an investor to earn excess returns." (Boehmer et al 2008:493)

"One might worry that our shorting measures are highly collinear with monthly changes in short interest, with little additional information provided by the higher frequency intermediate f lows." (Boehmer et al 2008:521)

"The null hypothesis is that the monthly changes in short interest are sufficient to capture the information possessed by short sellers." (Boehmer et al 2008:521)

"Short interest does not drive out the shorting f low measures." (Boehmer et al 2008:521)

"That is, once we control for shorting f low, changes in short interest are no longer significant predictors of the future cross-section of returns. This indicates that our measures dominate short interest as a proxy for the information in short sales." (Boehmer et al 2008:521)},

abstract = {Buying is easier than shorting for many equity investors. Combining this arbitrage asymmetry with the arbitrage risk represented by idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) explains the negative relation between IVOL and average return. The IVOL-return relation is negative among overpriced stocks but positive among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11 return anomalies. Consistent with arbitrage asymmetry, the negative relation among overpriced stocks is stronger, especially for stocks less easily shorted, so the overall IVOL-return relation is negative. Further supporting our explanation, high investor sentiment weakens the positive relation among underpriced stocks and, especially, strengthens the negative relation among overpriced stocks.},

We show that this earnings announcement premium is large, robust, and strongly related to the fact that volume surges around announcement dates. Stocks with high past announcement period volume earn the highest announcement premium, suggesting some common underlying cause for both volume and the premium. We show that high premium stocks experience the highest levels of imputed small investor buying, suggesting that the premium is driven by buying by small investors when the announcement catches their attention.},

abstract = {A crowded trade emerges when speculators' positions are large relative to the asset's liquidity, making exit difficult. We study this problem of recent regulatory concern by focusing on short-selling. We show that days to cover (DTC), the ratio of short interest to trading volume, measures the costliness of exiting crowded trades. Crowding is an important concern as short-sellers avoid illiquid stocks and require a premium to enter into such trades. A strategy shorting high DTC stocks and buying low DTC stocks generates a 1.2{\%} monthly return. A comparably large days-to-cover effect exists on the long positions of levered hedge funds.},

There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors, related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates, the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important, the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds.},

We find that the predictability of short sale constraints is stronger for stocks with low institutional ownership, while the predictability of informed trading is not related to institutional ownership. After large increases in institutional ownership and hedge fund assets in the second half of the sample period, the relationship between short sale constraints and future stock returns becomes weak, while that between informed trading and future stock returns remains the same.
