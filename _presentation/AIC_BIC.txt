Information-criterion based model selection is very fast, but it relies on a proper estimation of degrees of freedom, are derived for large samples (asymptotic results) and assume the model is correct, i.e. that the data are actually generated by this model. They also tend to break when the problem is badly conditioned (more features than samples).
